description: "Frustrated that UBC's Course search is horrendous and inconvenient? Need to view all course data in one page rather than clicking? This app can help. Made by scraping UBC's website. Built because UBC's course search sucks.<br><br>Used over 5500 times by 400+ people and saved countless of hours. (This gave me back the 3 hours it took to code this)"
technologies: ["Node.js", "Express", "Web Scraping", "Javascript"]
